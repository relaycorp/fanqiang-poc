# Network Layer implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the network layer of the gateway,
as defined in the 4-layer Internet model.
In other words, this is the implementation of the IPv4 and IPv6 layer.

The implementation of the layer above can be found under the [`serviceDataUnits`](../serviceDataUnits) directory.
