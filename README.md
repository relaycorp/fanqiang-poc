# Fān Qiáng ("翻墙") Proof of Concept

This is the Proof of Concept (PoC) of _Fān Qiáng_ ("翻墙"),
a VPN protocol that's resilient to [active probing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall#Active_probing) and
[enumeration](https://github.com/scriptzteam/Tor-Bridges-Collector).
This PoC turns **any HTTPS website** into a tunnel,
thus making user traffic pass off as regular web browsing.
Future versions of the protocol may support additional tunnelling methods,
such as videoconferencing software like Zoom.

## Demo

TODO.

## Scope

The objective of the PoC is to assess the feasibility of the protocol,
by focusing on the areas in which I personally lack experience (e.g. NATs, TUN devices).
Consequently,
those components in which I have extensive experience,
such as authentication and encryption,
are not implemented in the PoC.

## Architecture

TODO.
